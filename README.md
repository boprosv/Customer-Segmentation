# Customer-Segmentation
 Interactive AI-powered app
```text
This Customer Segmentation AI project is a data-driven application designed to help businesses better understand
 their customer base by grouping users into actionable clusters using machine learning.
 Built using Python and the Streamlit framework, it allows users to upload a dataset,
 automatically identifies key features, and runs clustering algorithms to divide customers into distinct groups.
 What sets this app apart is its use of GPT-4 via LangChain to auto-generate natural-language insights and
 business strategy recommendations for each cluster.
 The app provides not only interactive data visualizations (using Plotly)
but also generates downloadable PDF reports per cluster,
 including customer contact details for front office or marketing use.
